Northeastern's Group Fitness reservations are first-come-first-serve.  Let's get there first!

In spring 2015 I signed up for cycling classes at Northeastern to help train for a 2200 mile bicylce tour from Yorktown, VA
to Colorado Springs, CO.  I got tired of having to stay up late to register before the class reached capacity.
Thus, I put Selenium to use and threw the task on a cron job.
